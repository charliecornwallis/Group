Our research involves collecting data from wild, captive and laboratory organisms using a range of approaches including experimental evolution, molecular genetics and bioinformatics, field experiments, and literature searching. Our primary study organisms are algae, damselflies, moths, lizards and birds. Tasks involve data collection in the field and the laboratory, support for sample curation\/organisation, data organisation and processing including statistical analyses, and coordination and management of the research group\u2019s daily routines, including organism husbandry and administrative support. It is expected that the person assigned to this post will pursue opportunities to acquire further skills through national and international courses. The position is aimed at a junior level and it is therefore expected that any postdoctoral employment in research is limited to two years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Description of the qualifications that are required of the candidate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is essential that the applicant has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An MSc or PhD in Ecology, Evolution or Molecular Biology or a closely related field with strong emphasis on either or both of these subjects.<\/li>\n<li>Experience of working with microorganisms, particularly experimentation and maintaining laboratory populations<\/li>\n<li>Experience of molecular genetics including DNA extractions, PCR, next-generation sequencing<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It is desirable that the applicant has:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience of experimental evolution<\/li>\n<li>Experience of working with algae particularly identification and culturing of clones<\/li>\n<li>Experience of organizing databases and analyzing sequence data<\/li>\n<li>Experience with statistical analysis of data from field studies or experimental settings as well as experimental design<\/li>\n<li>A good command of the software R for programming, statistical analyses or graphical visualization of data<\/li>\n<li>Motivation to work in a team and desire to take responsibility<\/li>\n<li>Fluent in English. A good understanding of Swedish is advantageous but not required<\/li>\n<li>A full drivers license.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Basis of Assessment<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Applicants are evaluated based on how well they fulfill the requirements detailed above. Such evidence may include documentation of completed coursework, scientific publications, technical and analytical know-how, evidence of organizational skills and enthusiasm for ecology and evolution. Where possible, statements to these effects should be accompanied by objective or independent assessment of the candidate\u2019s track record and potential. These may include links to access published or unpublished (e.g., thesis) research material or letters of support from supervisors or previous employers.<\/p>\n<p>Salary will be set according to the general regulations for research technicians at Lund University in relation to the number of years research experience and achievements. Applicants should send a cover letter explaining their background and a CV that includes publications and the contact information for two referees.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Additional Information<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For more information and informal discussion about the position candidates can contact Charlie Cornwallis, Erik Svensson, or Tobias Uller.
